# WATER-LEVEL-INDICATOR
The project integrates a water level sensor with Arduino to accurately measure water levels.  
It utilizes conditional statements to activate LED's, signaling low, reasonable, and high water levels, while also triggering a buzzer to alert of potential overflow. 
Visual indication through LED's and auditory warnings via the buzzer are implemented to effectively monitor water levels in the project.
